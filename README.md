# 2048-Ascii

Remix of the original game: 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli.

Made by JustJeeCode in Python.

# How to play:

2048 is a puzzle game. The board is a 4 x 4 matrix that starts off with only 2 tiles.
Each tile starting off can be 2 or 4. You can move the board up, right, down and left which shifts all the tiles to that side.
If you get 2 tiles of the same value to connect they merge and double in value. 
If you fill up the board and have no more available moves you lose.

The goal of the game is to get a tile of the value 2048.
